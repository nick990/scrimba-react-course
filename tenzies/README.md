## Challenge 2

- Create a Die component that takes a `value` prop. Should render a button with that value displayed.
- Render 10 instances of the Die component (manually)
  - Provide a number between 1-6 for the value on each
    for now
- Style the <main> and <Die> components to look like they do in the slide
  - Hints: Create a container to hold the 10 instances of the Die component, and use CSS Grid to lay them out evenly in 2 rows of 5 columns
  - Use flexbox on main to center the dice container in the center of the page
