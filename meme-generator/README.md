# Meme Generator

## Challenge 1

Move the hardcoded meme info into React state.
Use an object with `topText`, `bottomText`, and `imageUrl` properties, and set the initial values to the ones hardcoded below.

## Challenge 2

Update the topText value in the meme state object every time the topText input box is changed

Note: don't worry about bottomText at this point.
