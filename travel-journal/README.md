# Travel Journal

## Challenge 1

- Create an App component in a separate file.\
  Import it here and render it
- Create a "components" folder and a Header component.\
  Render the Header inside the App component.
- Follow the Travel Journal design to build the Header\
  for our page.

## Challenge 2

Build out the Entry component and render 1 instance of it to the App

For now, just hard-code in the data, which you can find in
japan.md so you don't have to type it all out manually :)

Notes:

- Only render 1 instance of this Entry component for now
- I've pulled in marker.png for the little map marker icon
  that goes next to the location name
- The main purpose of this challenge is to show you where our limitations
  currently are, so don't worry about the fact that you're hard-coding all
  this data into the component.
