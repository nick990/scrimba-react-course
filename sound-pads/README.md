# Sound Pads

## Challenge 1

1. Initialize state with the default value of the array pulled in from pads.js
2. Map over that state array and display each one as a `<button>` (CSS is already written for you)\
   (Don't worry about using the "on" or "color" properties yet)

## Challenge 2

Use a ternary to determine the backgroundColor of the buttons:

- If darkMode is true, set them to "#222222"
- If darkMode is false, set them to "#cccccc"
