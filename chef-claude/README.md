## Challenge 1

Build the Header component in a separate file and render it here in the App component.

## Challenge 2

Map over the list of ingredients and render them as list items

Note: We're doing things a weird way here. Don't worry, we're building up to learning the right way 🙂

## Challenge 3

Add an `onSubmit` event listener on the form. Have the function simply console.log("Form submitted!") for now
