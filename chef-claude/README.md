## Challenge 1

Build the Header component in a separate file and render it here in the App component.

## Challenge 2

Map over the list of ingredients and render them as list items

Note: We're doing things a weird way here. Don't worry, we're building up to learning the right way 🙂

## Challenge 3

Add an `onSubmit` event listener on the form. Have the function simply console.log("Form submitted!") for now

## Challenge 4

Add the new ingredient to the array of ingredients. Also, add a
console.log(ingredients) after adding the ingredient, because
**warning**: you aren't going to see the page update!

## Challenge 5

Update our app so that when the user enters a
new ingredient and submits the form, it adds that new
ingredient to our list!

## Challenge 6

Use form action instead of onSubmit to handle the data from the form.

## Challenge 7

Using conditional rendering, only render the new `<section>` IF
there are ingredients added to the list of ingredients.
